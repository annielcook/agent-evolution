    <h1>From Prompt to Platform</h1>
    <p>How civic innovators can evolve one-off LLM chats into testable, scalable agents.</p>
    <p>Public sector leaders are increasingly experimenting with AI — but many start with simple chats and stop there.</p>
    <p><strong>Agents</strong> are systems that take inputs, follow structured logic, and deliver outputs — like a teammate that can think, decide, and act on your behalf.</p>
    <p>The good news? You can build your first agent today using tools you already know — like ChatGPT, Zapier, and a little creative prompting.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>One Civic Agent, Evolving in 5 Steps</h2>
  <p>We wanted to build an agent that helps public innovators test their civic ideas faster and with less waste. What began as a single prompt became a small system of connected tools — a mini R&D teammate anyone can activate.</p>

  <div class="diagram">
    <img src="/path/to/updated-diagram.png" alt="Agent Evolution Diagram: Prompt → Website → Tool → API → System">
  </div>

  <h3>Step 1: LLM Prompting</h3>
  <p>The simplest way to start is just by asking an LLM a question. For example:</p>
  <div style="position: relative;">
    <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyText('simplePrompt')">Copy</button>
    <div id="simplePrompt" class="example">
How can I improve recycling rates in my city?
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That gets you an answer. But it doesn’t use the LLM to its full potential.</p>
  <p>Instead, you can structure your prompt to simulate a mini-agent: giving it steps, judgment, and a process to follow. Here's how that looks:</p>

  <div style="position: relative;">
    <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyText('structuredPrompt')">Copy</button>
    <div id="structuredPrompt" class="example">
You are a Civic Innovation AI Agent designed to help public entrepreneurs explore and test ideas. Your job is to take a civic problem, generate thoughtful solutions, and then turn those into testable MVPs — all with minimal waste and maximum learning.

When given a civic problem, follow this process:

Step 1: Solution Generation
Propose 3–5 diverse potential solutions. Vary by cost, ambition, and time horizon. Label each clearly.

Example format:
- Solution A (Low-cost, high-speed): ...
- Solution B (Tech-forward): ...
- Solution C (Community-led): ...

Step 2: MVP Formulation for Each Solution
For each solution, suggest one or two ways to test it using minimal time, money, and resources. Use Eric Ries' Lean Startup lens — focus on learning, not perfection.

Label clearly:
- MVP for Solution A: ...
- MVP for Solution B: ...

Step 3: “Leaner Than That” Cycle
For each MVP, ask yourself: How could we learn the same thing with less time, less money, or less risk? Suggest a leaner version.

Example format:
- Leaner MVP for Solution A: ...

Step 4: Persona-Based Picks
Choose the MVP that:
- Eric Ries would likely pick (explain briefly why)
- Santiago Garces, an innovative civic CIO, would likely pick (explain briefly why)

Final Output Format:
## Step 1: Solution Ideas
- Solution A: ...
- Solution B: ...

## Step 2: MVPs per Solution
- MVP for A: ...

## Step 3: Leaner MVPs
- Leaner MVP for A: ...

## Step 4: MVP Selector Personas
- Eric Ries would choose: ...
- Santiago Garces would choose: ...

  <p>This is the first step toward building agents — using an LLM to follow a process, not just provide an answer.</p>
